**This analysis involves the examination of relevant primary and secondary sources, including military reports, official documents, media sources, and various databases, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the operational situation regarding missile and UAV strikes.**

The objectives of this analysis are:

* To examine and understand the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' anti-aircraft defense capabilities in countering threats posed by drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles belonging to the Russian Armed Forces.

* To conduct a spatial analysis of attacks launched by the Russian Armed Forces on both civilian and military infrastructure in Ukraine. This analysis will include highlighting the launch locations of missiles or drones, or the carrying platforms of such military equipment, as well as the impact locations of these attacks.

* Furthermore, we will monitor the times of day when these attacks were carried out to identify any correlation between the time of day and the effectiveness of these attacks. This will provide a deeper understanding of the Russian Armed Forces' combat strategy in the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine.
